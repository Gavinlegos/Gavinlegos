- 👋 Hi, I’m @Gavinlegos
- 👀 I’m interested in learning about the different ways to use the markdowns and how that overall creates the build in a website or game. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the basics of markdowns and the base level coding.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects and the group work we have for this year and learning how to create my own game
- 📫 How to reach me the best way to reach me is on teams right now just because my email is flooded with college emails.
I do not have any prior coding experience to this class.  I wanted to take this class to learn more about the background of everyday tech, I think its a massive gorwing industry and I wanted to learn more.
My other intrests include surfing, snowboarding, football, lacrosse and I like to take pictures and use a camera.  In school I like math and solving equations. 
I want to come out of this class with a good grade, but also learn code which I know nothing about.  I want to be able to use what I learn in the class for my future endevers.
